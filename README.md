# Sentiment-Analysis-Stock-Price
This project implements sentiment analysis using the Random Forest algorithm and the bag of words technique. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone behind a piece of text, such as a review or a social media post. It is a valuable tool in various domains, including customer feedback analysis, brand monitoring, and market research.
# Random Forest Algorithm
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. In the context of sentiment analysis, Random Forest can effectively classify text by learning from a set of labeled data. Each decision tree in the forest independently predicts the sentiment of a given text, and the final sentiment is determined by majority voting.
# Bag of Words Technique
The bag of words technique is a common approach for text feature extraction. It represents a text document as a collection, or "bag," of its constituent words, disregarding grammar and word order. This technique creates a numerical representation of the text, which can then be used as input for machine learning algorithms. Each word becomes a feature, and the count or presence of each word is used to create the feature vector.
# Implementation Details
1. Data Preprocessing: The text data is preprocessed by removing any unnecessary characters, converting the text to lowercase, and removing stop words. This helps in reducing    noise and improving the quality of the input data.

2. Feature Extraction: The bag of words technique is used to convert the preprocessed text data into a numerical representation. Each unique word in the dataset becomes a        feature, and its count or presence is calculated for each text document.

3. Random Forest Model Training: The preprocessed data is divided into training and testing sets. The Random Forest algorithm is trained on the training set, using the bag of    words features and corresponding sentiment labels.

4. Sentiment Analysis: Once the Random Forest model is trained, it can be used to predict the sentiment of new, unseen text data. The model takes the bag of words   
   representation of the text as input and predicts the sentiment label.
